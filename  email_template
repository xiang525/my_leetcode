Hi Lori, 

I'm a PhD in computer science. I am quite interested in the technical data analyst position in Groupon. 
My research relates to Big Data analytics (ETL) and user behavior.
My skillsets cover Hadoop HDFS, MapReduce, Spark, MongoDB, SQL. Python and Java are the main programming language I used most of the time.
If there is a good match, please let me know.

Thanks!

-Xiang (Emily)
